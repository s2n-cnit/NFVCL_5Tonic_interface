# "NFVCL 5Tonic Interface" (NTI)
The "NFVCL 5Tonic Interface" (NAI) is the south-bound component to allow NFVCL to interact with 5Tonic 5G core subsystem (named "spanish exFa" in the "5G-Induce" project, [5G-Induce project](https://www.5g-induce.eu/)) .

## NFVCL
The NFVCL is a network-oriented meta-orchestrator, specifically designed for zeroOps and continuous automation. 
It can create, deploy and manage the lifecycle of different network ecosystems by consistently coordinating multiple 
artefacts at any programmability levels (from physical devices to cloud-native microservices).
A more detailed description of the NFVCL will be added to the [Wiki](https://nfvcl-ng.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
